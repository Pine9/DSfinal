# The Science of Stolen Data

* **Problem**: The prevalence of large-scale data breaches and their far-reaching effects
* **Background**: <br>
&emsp;&emsp;
A *data breach* is the exposure of data to parties who are not authorized to access it. A data breach can be caused by digital vulnerabilities, but may also be caused by the direct actions of humans (for example, theft or human error). Culprits include "accidental insiders" -- those who may stumble across confidential data without having the proper permissions to view it. Even an accidental viewing of the secret data is considered a breach. In some cases, a device containing the data may be lost or stolen. There are also malicious insiders and outsiders who aim to access confidential data, possibly using it to harm a company and its customers [1]. For the average user, credentials and personal information may be made available to the public, leaving them vulnerable to hackers.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;
In the United States, if a data breach of an entity exposes any personally identifiable information belonging to users, then the entity is required by law to disclose the breach and notify the affected users [3]. After the breach, the victim can do little to take back the information that has been leaked. However, they may harden their security to make such an attack less likely in the future.
* **Questions**:
    - What is the primary cause of data breaches?
    - When it comes to data security, should an organization prioritize physical security or cybersecurity (weighing both the frequency and magnitude of incidents)?
    - Does a breach typically take place over a long/short period of time?
* **Justification**: <br>
&emsp;&emsp;
In 2019, the average cost of cleaning up a data breach was over 8 million dollars -- with the healthcare industry being hit the hardest [2]. When we consider the sometimes priceless nature of data, we can understand that a data breach is clearly something that governments, organizations, and end users would wish to prevent.
